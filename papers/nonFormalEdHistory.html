        <p>Even today there appears to be little consensus as to what exactly Non-Formal Education (NFE) is. Some scholars do not
        even distinguish NFE from Informal Education (Rogers, 2005). In fact, there is a lack of agreement as to what
        constitutes Formal Education, Non-Formal Education, and Informal Education (Malcolm, Hodkinson, & Colley, 2003). NFE has
        had such a turbulent history, that some scholars avoid the term entirely in favour of more neutral names.</p>
        <p>Further, even theoretical explorations of NFE has seemed to cease. Contemporary literature generally excludes any discussion about the history or heritage of NFE (Rogers, 2005). This exclusion is problematic because it also ends discussions about
        alternate forms of education that are more flexible than current models (Hoppers, 2006). Thus, the concept of NFE needs
        to be discussed and clarified if we hope to move forward in the field (Rogers, 2005).</p>
        <p>In the 1960s, people began to raise issues with Western forms of education and the climate became critical of the
        current educational paradigm (Rogers, 2005). The model was one of a Teacher-Learner, which treated students as passive
        receptacles of knowledge, valuing docility and memorization above creativity and independence (La Belle, 1982). These
        education systems are captive, or involuntary, and privilege academic subjects over other ways of knowing, such as life
        experience (La Belle, 1982). This impersonalizes knowledge and skills from the learner (Rogers, 2005).</p> 
        <p>Teaching subjects in isolation ignore the interconnective nature of knowledge. Further, the education model imposes an
        ideological belief system on students that claims that math and science are value neutral and a superior way of
        understanding the world (Rogers, 2005). In fact, regardless of cultural context, all schools devote approximately the
        same amount of time to academic subjects. As cited in Rogers, the world bank found that:</p>
        <blockquote>Regardless of the level of economic or educational development, countries now teach the same subjects and accord them the same relative importance. Approximately 35% of available instructional time is devoted to the acquisition of
        language skills and 18% of time to mathematics. Science, social studies and the arts are given equal weight, about half
        that of mathematics and one-fourth that of language (World Bank 1990, p. 16 as cited in Rogers, 2005).</blockquote>
        <p>To add to the growing discontent with educational dogma, people also began to question if the education model was
        performing its intended role. Employers were finding that graduates were not equipped with the skills necessary for jobs
        and had to supply additional training to new employees. Employers viewed education as too theoretical and not practical
        enough. </p>
        <p>The lack of skills of educated graduates led to an interested paradox. There was an increase in educated people,
        but there was also an increase in unemployment because the unemployed lacked the required job related skills. This over
        production of graduates led to education inflation. Jobs that use to require only high school education (because skills
        were learned on the job), began to require an undergraduate degree because the competition was higher. </p>
        <p>In this environment, education was not an equalizer, but rather the opposite. Investments in education merely increases the
        education needed for lower skill jobs, reinforcing existing social structures that favour the economically advantaged
        persons, thus exaggerating existing inequalities (Rogers, 2005).</p>
        <p>Within this context of disapproval in the 1960s, Non-Formal Education emerged. The purpose of NFE was to address the
        demand for out-of-school education solutions (La Belle, 1982). Supporters of NFE hoped that offering educational
        programs removed from formal channels (i.e. current models of education) would provide relevant education contextualized
        to the environment (Rogers, 2005). </p>
        <p>The term Non Formal Education first appeared in 1968 when Philip Coombs suggested as a solution to the ‘World Educational Crisis’ (Rogers, 2005). The crisis was that the third world’s population was rapidly growing and the current educational model was not adequately servicing the growing need for education (La Belle, 1982). Therefore, much of the early discussion surrounding NFE throughout the 1970-80s focused on the application of NFE programs in developing nations, even though it was Western nations that conceived, created, and implemented NFE programs. NFE was to run parallel to the existing educational institutions to serve as an alternative that focuses on teaching skills needed for developing a country (Rogers, 2005).</p>
        <p class='centreText'>***</p>
        <p>This article has intentionally described NFE vaguely. <a href='definitionOfNonFormalEd.html'>See this article to explore the lack of clarity in the concept further</a>. It is important to acknowledge the lack of clarity is due to its historical roots. The historical climate surrounding the creation of NFE encouraged the construction of a binary opposition to the current educational model, termed Formal Education (FE).</p>
        <p>The cultural climate was disappointed with the formal system and wanted something unlike it, something non-formal. Thus, NFE was defined as not FE. The barrier between FE and NFE was that one was in a school and the other was outside of that system. Any discussion about NFE started with how it differed from FE; the assumption being that the formal system was normal.</p>
        <p>The problem with this discourse was that at no point during the creation of NFE did anyone question, what is Formal Education (Rogers, 2005)? There were many assumptions about each. For example, proponents of NFE believed that it focused on the students’ needs; whereas, FE imposed predetermined objectives (Carron & Carr-Hill, 1991). But these assumptions were not tested. </p>
		<blockquote class="fancy">Since the 1980s, discourse regarding NFE is almost non-existent. Even the term Non-Formal Education is carefully avoided due to its disgraced past.</blockquote>
        <p>It was not until around 1986 that a branch of Empirical NFE theorist emerged with the goal to define the boundaries between FE and NFE objectively (Rogers, 2005). They did this by comparing non-school educational programs with school programs. In the end, they were not able to find distinguishing differences between FE and NFE and concluded that the boundaries were fuzzy. Both systems could share similar processes or character, may or may not be government funded/supported, and vary in the formality or informality of the learning environment (Rogers, 2005).</p>
        <p>In the 1980s, the lack of success of NFE further heightened the growing discontent with lack of clarity around NFE. Many non-formal vocational programs launched in Africa to solve development struggles failed. Many Africans rejected the NFE programs
        because they saw them as second-class education. Those that NFE sought to serve rejected the programs. </p>
        <p>This problem was not unique to Africa: the poor rarely choose NFE over FE. The lack of acceptance was, ironically, due to education (Rogers, 2005). The epistemological basis of education is that formal education is legitimate and normal. Therefore, the illegitimacy of NFE can act to reinforce socio-economic boundaries by being labeled as non-standard and undesired. NFE
        may afford them the skills, but not the cultural acceptance (La Belle, 1982).</p> 
        <p>This is not to say that NFE did not succeed at all. The success of NFE has been in industrial countries, urban centres (La Belle, 1982), and countries with high rates of education (Carron & Carr-Hill, 1991), not the targeted developing nations.</p>
		<p>The 1980s also saw the development of four strains of NFE theorist: the Empirical, discussed earlier, the Advocate, the
		Ideological, and the Pragmatic. The Advocate and Ideological are continuations of the old discourse surrounding NFE.
		Advocates believe that NFE can be a platform for societal change, and the Ideologists see NFE in opposition to FE
		(Rogers, 2005). </p>
		<p>The pragmatic approach is much more similar to my approach to NFE. They believe that FE and NFE are
		approaches to educating that are not separate or exclusionary, but rather on a spectrum and can be simultaneously
		present (Rogers, 2005). For example, a school could teach a social studies class using Formal approaches, yet also
		enhance learning by offering a Non-Formal extra-curricular club (e.g. debate team, or model UN club), and further
		support learning by encouraging Informal peer learning groups.</p>
		<p>Since the 1980s, discourse regarding NFE is almost non-existent. Even the term Non-Formal Education is carefully avoided
		due to its disgraced past. It became too difficult to discuss NFE without dredging up its highly politicized past. </p>
		<p>The history of NFE can give the term both positive and negative connotations. On one hand, NFE is demonized for creating a
		non-white, non-normal, and non-desired distinction in education; and praised on the other as the liberation from
		oppressive FE approaches. </p>
		<p>New terms have taken the place of Non-Formal Education, such as Non-Formal Channels, or Non-Formal Communications to avoid the connotations, and papers that do still use the term NFE include little theoretical discussion or explanation of NFE (Rogers, 2005).</p>
