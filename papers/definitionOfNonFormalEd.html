        <h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>There seems to be some agreement between scholars that formal, nonformal, and informal education exist; however, there
		is no definitive classification system to categorize these forms of learning. The purpose of this paper is to propose a
		simple and satisfactory classification system that can capture and classify all the types of learning into one of four
		categories. The four categories include the mentioned categories of formal, nonformal, and informal learning, but I also
		include the forth category of incidental learning. The classification system is divided along two axes, whether the
		learning is perceived as being compulsorily and whether the learning is self-directed or led by an expert.</p>
		<h3>The Classification of Learning</h3>
		<p>Thus far, there is no agreed upon definitive definition of what constitutes formal, nonformal, and informal education
		(Malcolm, Hodkinson, & Colley, 2003). Part of the problem with defining these educational types is that each comes with
		epistemological baggage. </p>
		<p>Ideas of the nature of learning, knowledge empowerment, and positivist practices are associated
		with each term and enviably invade the discussion (Colley, Hodkinson, & Malcolm, 2002). This is a problem because the
		discussion surrounding the classification of formal, nonformal, and informal education has been political, not
		categorical.</p>
		<p>In the 1960s, people began to raise issues with Western forms of education and the climate became critical of the
		current educational paradigm (Rogers, 2005). The model was one of a Teacher-Learner, which treated students as passive
		receptacles of knowledge, valuing docility and memorization above creativity and independence (La Belle, 1982).</p> 
		<p>These education systems were captive or involuntary and privilege academic subjects over other ways of knowing, such as life
		experience (La Belle, 1982), thus impersonalizing knowledge and skills from the learner (Rogers, 2005). Teaching
		subjects in isolation also ignored the interconnective nature of knowledge. Further, the education model imposed an
		ideological belief system on students that claimed that math and science are value neutral and a superior way of
		understanding the world.</p> 
		<p>Yet, employers were finding that graduates were not equipped with the skills necessary for jobs
		and had to supply additional training to new employees. Employers viewed education as too theoretical and not practical
		enough. (Rogers, 2005).</p>
		<p>Within this context of disapproval in the 1960s, nonformal education emerged. The purpose of nonformal education was to
		address the demand for out-of-school education solutions (La Belle, 1982). Supporters of nonformal education hoped that
		offering educational programs removed from formal channels (i.e. current models of education) would provide relevant
		education contextualized to the environment (Rogers, 2005). </p>
		<p>The term nonformal education first appeared in 1968 when Philip Coombs suggested it as a solution to the ‘World Educational Crisis’ (Rogers, 2005). The crisis was that the third world’s population was rapidly growing and the current educational model was not adequately servicing the growing need for education (La Belle, 1982).</p>
		<p>The historical climate surrounding the creation of nonformal education encouraged the construction of a binary
		opposition to the current educational model, termed formal education. The cultural climate was disappointed with the
		formal system and wanted something unlike it, something non-formal. Thus, nonformal education was defined as not formal
		education. </p>
		<p>The distinction between formal education and nonformal education was that one was in a school and the other
		was outside of that system. Any discussion about nonformal education started with how it differed from formal education;
		the assumption being that the formal system was normal (Rogers, 2005). </p>
		<p>The problem with this discourse was that at no point during the creation of nonformal education did anyone question: what is formal education? There were many assumptions about each; for example, proponents of nonformal education believed that it focused on the students’ needs, whereas formal education imposed predetermined objectives (Carron & Carr-Hill, 1991), but the assumptions were not tested.</p>
		<p>It was not until around 1986 that a branch of Empirical nonformal education theorists emerged with the goal to define
		the boundaries between formal education and nonformal education objectively (Rogers, 2005). They did this by comparing
		educational programs outside of schools with school programs. In the end, they were not able to find distinguishing
		differences between formal education and nonformal education and concluded that the boundaries were fuzzy. Both systems
		could share similar processes or character, may or may not be government funded/supported, and vary in the formality or
		informality of the learning environment (Rogers, 2005).</p>
		<p>Further complicating the classification of education is that nonformal education is also defined in opposition to
		informal education. Informal education being defined as:</p>
		<blockquote>…the spontaneous, unstructured learning that goes on daily in the home and neighborhood, behind the school and on the playing field, in the workplace, marketplace, library and museum, and through the various mass media, all of which
		constitute a person’s informal learning environment. (Coombs, 1985, p. 92)</blockquote>
		<p>Whereas, nonformal education consists of:</p>
		<blockquote>…any organized, systematic, educational activity, carried on outside the framework of the formal system, to provide
		selected types of learning to particular subgroup in the population of adults as well as children. (Coombs, 1985, p. 23)</blockquote>
		<p>The defining feature that separates these two systems appears to be organization. Informal education is sporadic;
		nonformal is organized. However, depending who organized the education, it might actually be formal, not nonformal
		education.</p>
		<p>Granted, Coombs does not believe that each of these categories are distinct and separate. For example, attending a
		museum is categorized as informal education; yet joining a guided tour at the museum falls under the category of
		nonformal education; unless your school scheduled the tour, which would shift it into formal territory. Therefore,
		Coombs categories can be better seen on two planes; the formalness of the educational characteristics and the
		educational mode (La Belle, 1982).</p>
		<h3>Why Do We Need a New Classification of Learning?</h3>
		<p>The distinction between formal, nonformal, and informal education remains unclear. Nonformal education is hardly a
		“handy generic label” (Coombs, 1985, p. 23). Authors even use different definitions of nonformal education within the
		same piece of work. </p>
		<p>Even Coombs, who coined the term, is not consistent in the scope of nonformal education (Rogers,
		2005). For example, in 1968, he refers to nonformal education as “an untidy mélange that defies simple description, or
		the diagnosis and measurement of systematic planning (Coombs, 1968, p. 138)”, quite different then the “handy generic
		label” later described.</p>
		<p>The root of the definition of the educational formats appears to be the separation between school and non-school (La
		Belle, 1982). However, the concept of what school refers to is also vague. </p>
		<p>Malcolm, Hodkinson, and Colley (2003) suggested a rubric to determine the level of formality and informality of education. They believe the level of formality can be determined by analyzing four aspects of the educational environment:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The process: the structure of learning, which ranges from incidental learning in everyday activities to structured
			teacher-controlled activities.</li>
			<li>The location: the location where the learning takes place. Formal locations would include schools and less formal
			locations would be the workplace or community centres.</li>
			<li>The purpose: informal learning purposes would include learning that is for the sake of knowledge and formal learning
			purpose would include developing skills to increase productivity.</li>
			<li>The content: formal content would be content taught by experts, whereas less formal content would include generation
			of competencies or new knowledge.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The above model, however, does little to clarify the concept of formal, nonformal, and informal education and certainly
		does not address the connotations surrounding formal and non-formal education.</p>
		<p>Granted, the proposed system of classification in this paper cannot extinguish the connotations surrounding the concept
		on formal and nonformal education, but it does move us away from a classification system rooted in epistemological
		debate of formalness. The following model highlights how power dynamics change the perception of education, rather than
		the reverse.</p>
		<h3>Pedagogue-Autonomy Scale Classification</h3>
		<p>Despite the definitional arguments that continue surrounding the classification of formal, nonformal, and informal
		education, there seems to be some consistent factors. Both definitions of formal and nonformal education describe the
		learning as administered by an expert in that domain. The process by which the education is imparted to the individual
		may vary, but the theme of a student/teacher, mentor/protégée, master/apprentice, etc. relationship appears to be
		central. The learning is lead by an expert and imparted to the learner.</p>
		<p>The second constant that seems to divide nonformal and informal from formal education is the notion of autonomy. Are the learners utilizing the educational system because they have been mandated, or are they seeking knowledge to address their needs
		and context? </p>
		<p>There is the notion of formal education being compulsory. Students need to complete their education to
		receive validated credentials necessary for employment. Nonformal education and informal education, however, strive to
		be context dependent and aim to provide the learner with an opportunity to learn about something that is personally
		valuable to them. Nonformal and informal education is generally not needed, rather desired.</p>
		<p>If we chart the pedagogical aspect of educational environments and the autonomous aspects on the axes of a chart (figure
		1), we get the following description of the educational landscape:</p>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<th></th>
				<th></th>
				<th colspan="2">Who Leads the Education?</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th></th>
				<th></th>
				<th class='tableHeader'>Expert</th>
				<th class='tableHeader'>Self</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th class='y-axis' rowspan="2">Perception of Necessity</th>
				<th class='tableHeader y-axis'>Compulsory</th>
				<td>Formal</td>
				<td>?</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th class='tableHeader y-axis'>Non-Compulsory</th>
				<td>Nonformal</td>
				<td>Informal</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<caption><span class='credit'>Figure 1: Pedagogue-Autonomy Scale of Learning Environment Classification</span></caption>
		<p>This classification, then predicts a fourth category of learning that is viewed by the learner as compulsory and is
		self-directed. And in fact, the literature has already identified this type of learning.</p>
		<p>Although Coombs included in his definition of informal education learning that sporadically occurred throughout the day
		via work or play (Coombs, 1985), today we distinguish this as type of informal learning called incidental learning.
		Marksick and Watkins define incidental learning as:</p>
		<blockquote>Incidental learning is defined as a byproduct of some other activity, such as task accomplishment, interpersonal
		interaction, sensing the organizational culture, trial-and-error experimentation, or even formal learning. Informal
		learning can be deliberately encouraged by an organization or it can take place despite an environment not highly
		conducive to learning. Incidental learning, on the other hand, almost always takes place although people are not always
		conscious of it. (Marsick & Watkins, 2001, p. 25)</blockquote>
		<p>Thus, you can see how by that definition the learning is self-directed, yet perceived as compulsory. The learning is
		needed to complete a task that must be done. Although an expert might guide the task, by definition, the individual
		directs incidental learning; it is a by-product of the individual’s activity, not directly learnt from an expert. </p>
		<p>The learning is contextual and sporadic and occurs out of necessity not an innate interest. The activity is framed as just a
		small part of a larger goal. For example, I never put time aside to learn how to use search engines; however, I have
		needed to use search engines many times to solve problems and in the process learned how to use them better. </p>
		<p>Once we add incidental learning, the final classification system looks like this:</p>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<th></th>
				<th></th>
				<th colspan="2">Who Leads the Education?</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th></th>
				<th></th>
				<th class='tableHeader'>Expert</th>
				<th class='tableHeader'>Self</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th class='y-axis' rowspan="2">Perception of Necessity</th>
				<th class='tableHeader y-axis'>Compulsory</th>
				<td>Formal</td>
				<td>Incidental</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th class='tableHeader y-axis'>Non-Compulsory</th>
				<td>Nonformal</td>
				<td>Informal</td>
			</tr>
		</table>

		<p>Going back to my previous example of the student attending a guided tour at museum as part of a class field trip, we can
		see how we might view the educational environment. </p>
		<p>Much like Coombs model, the learning can be seen on two plains: the educational mode and the learning activity. From the perspective of the student, attending the museum was compulsory and the learning objectives were set by their teacher, the overall learning mode can be seen as formal. </p>
		<p>However, each learning activity can be further classified as formal, nonformal, informal, or incidental. Thus, if the student chooses to learn more about a topic by going through the information that the museum provided they are engaging in a nonformal learning activity. If the student then decides to further their knowledge by asking questions or searching for more information on the internet, they are engaging in an informal learning activity because their learning has become self-directed. During this whole process, the student might have incidentally learned many things such as: how to use internet to search for information, how to behave at a museum, new vocabulary, etc.</p>
		<h3>How to use this Model</h3>
		<p>Beyond merely classifying learning, this model is designed to serve as a guide when constructing learning activities.
		Different learning activities are better suited for different learning environments and have different implications for
		assessment. For example, if a student will be graded on a learning task, the task has become by definition compulsory.
		The student must complete the task to demonstrate that they learnt something. Using this type of assessment limits
		learning tasks to formal and incidental learning. Both are well suited for this type of assessment because the object of
		assessment is fairly straight forward, can the student demonstrate the task, or has the student demonstrated that they
		retained what the expert has taught them. It becomes more complicated when looking at nonformal and informal learning.</p>
		<p>According to this model, nonformal education is lead by an expert, but not compulsory. In other words, nonformal
		education is much like a game. People participate because they want to participate, but they are limited in their
		ability to control the game because the rules have already been firmly established by an outside source. </p>
		<p>People participate because they desire to, but at anytime can stop participating by saying “I am not playing anymore”
		(Caillois, 1961). When that element of freedom is removed from a game by making the activity compulsory, the play
		element, or intrinsic motivation, of the activity is destroyed. Therefore it is important to centre any
		game-based-learning actives or intrinsically motivated learning as informal or nonformal learning activities. </p>
		<p>Informal educational tasks, must not only protect the students’ freedom to participate, but also allow them to guide their own learning. This type of learning task is well suited for creative endeavors such as problem solving or artistic
		expression. The student can learn through trial and error, which does not restrict the students’ autonomy.</p>
		<p>The learning activities do not have to, and should not, work in isolation as described above. All learning activities
		should contain an element from each of the categories. This can be done by separating out what the student can decide on
		their own, and what needs to be supported by an expert. </p>
		<p>The student could set goals for aspects of a lesson and create self-directed learning objectives. This would allow them to apply their learning to authentic novel situations. In the process, the student will need to demonstrate their abilities and it is this area that the student can be assessed by an expert. However, the assessment itself could be transformed into a non-formal learning activity if the expert provides feedback to guide the student on how to improve their work, but allows the student to choose whether to use the information and re-submit their work. Treating assessment like a non-formal learning activity has the additional benefit of reducing the high stakes nature of assessment and rewards learning from failure.</p>
		<p>For example, we could imagine a learning environment where we have assigned student to write an essay paper for an
		English class. The formal aspect of the assignment could be demonstrating the student’s ability to construct a
		grammatical and organized document, which they would be formally assessed on. </p>
		<p>The non-formal aspect could be the research process. The student could choose the topic, but be guided in the process of finding the information and constructing an argument on their topic. As part of the assessment of their paper, they could be advised how they could better support their argument. This aspect of the assignment would not be graded, but the student would have the opportunity to re-submit or continue to work on this skill, under the guidance of their instructor, if they wish to do
		so. </p>
		<p>Because the topic of the paper would be chosen by the student, the actual learning of the information in the
		paper would be informal learning that was self-directed by the student. Finally, many incidental learning opportunities
		could be built into the project. The students could be encouraged to use the library resources for the research, or use
		new software to manage their project or paper. </p>
		<p>A later project perhaps could then build on this project by moving the research process into the formal education area and challenging students to further develop their writing skills in a non-formal capacity. The goal would be to always offer students ways to continue to challenge their learning, but never overwhelming them by turning all their learning into a high stakes judgement.</p>
		<h3>Conclusion</h3>
		<p>There are two purposes of the Pedagogue-Autonomy Scale Classification tool. The first function is to give educators a
		way to classify learning objectives that is defined by the learners experience and not the political baggage that can
		accompany the learning definitions. </p>
		<p>The second purpose is to give instructors a tool to aid in reflective teaching practices. The tool can be used by instructors to reflect on that nature of their learning activities from the prospective of the student.
		Understanding whether the student is given autonomy in their learning can help instructors to understand the power
		dynamics of their learning objects. </p>
		<p>Are the lessons designed to empower the learner, or are the lessons primarily focused on treating the student like a receptacle for knowledge? Does the assessment provide value to the student or is it robbing the student of their freedom of effort, which is essential for intrinsic motivation? This tool aims to expose these power dynamics and give educators the vocabulary to discuss them.</p>
