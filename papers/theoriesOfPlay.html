        <p>This article outlines the major theorists that have contributed to the theory of play pertaining to learning. It is
        important to note that there are other theories of play, but only those that pertain to learning are covered. The theorist are listed chronologically to illustrate the development of understanding over time.</p>
        <p>Although the theory of play has a rich history, it dramatically drops off by the 1970s. In the late 1980s evolutionary
        psychology turned their focus back towards play with the works of Bekoff and Byers (Smith, 2007), but these works did
        not heavily influence the field of education. </p>
        <p>The 1920s to 1970s were, however, rich with literature on play with relation to education. In fact, all of the social theorists outlined in this article fall into this timeframe. Most of play research in the 20th century has been based on Piaget theories (Pellegrini, 2007), and as late as 1993 the debate as to whether Piaget’s or Vygotsky theories are better has been active (e.g. Nicolopoulou, 1993).</p>
        <h3>Groos: Pre-Exercise Theory (1901)</h3>
        <p>Although Groos wrote about play over a hundred years ago, it is important to start any discussion of the history of play
        in learning with his theories. His work was very influential and appears to be the foundation upon which later theorist
        developed their theories of play (e.g. Koffka, 1924; Piaget, 1951; Caillois, 1961). </p>
        <p>His earlier works concentrated on play in animals; therefore, it is not surprising that his theories are biological in nature. He believed that children needed play to practice complex inborn behavioural adaptations. He also believed that the environment was too complex for humans to survive without practice.</p> 
        <p>It would be a mistake to think that he thought play was instinctual, however. Play was more complex than instinct; yet he saw instinctual qualities in it (e.g. the young imitating adults) (Groos, 1901a). Thus, he characterised play as:</p>
        <blockquote>... the product of ‘natural or hereditary impulse,’ although even that is not entirely satisfactory, since many
        psychologists connect the idea of impulse with a tendency to physical movement. There are undoubtedly deep-rooted
        requirements of our nature which this definition does not include, and which must be given due weight in our study of
        play. (Groos, 1901a, p. 2).</blockquote>
        <p>His influential book <span class='italics'>The Play of Man</span> concentrated on cataloguing the functions play served using ethologic methodology, which is a method from the biological sciences that records and categorizes behaviour by grouping behaviours with similar movements and outcomes.</p>
        <p>The third and final part of the book, which was relatively short, focused on the theories of play from five
        standpoints. The five standpoints include the physiological, biological, psychological, aesthetic, and the pedagogical.
        For the purpose of this discussion, the summary is limited to the pedagogical standpoint. </p>
        <p>Groos noted that play has been recognized as having educational value back to the time of Plato, with the exception of some religious scholars, who believed that play leads people away from god to the devil. He believed that children could be educated using either a serious or playful approach, but encouraged a playful approach. </p>
        <p>However, he noted that adding pedagogic purposes to play, especially by unskilled educators, destroys the freedom and genuineness of play. He suggested that the role of an instructor is not to mandate play, but rather guide play. Providing children with playthings that suggest the intention of use can guide spontaneous play (Groos, 1901b). The section ends with an outline of rules for educators:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Children should not play too much. Children should not use all of their productive energy on play.</li>
            <li>If play becomes violent, restrain the behaviour and treat the experience as an opportunity to teach ethical lessons
            regarding the importance of self-control.</li>
            <li>Restrict dangerous activities without being overly cautious, which could retard the development of courage.</li>
            <li>Restrict fighting when done in an ill-mannered way with the intention of emotionally harming another.</li>
            <li>Ensure that children participate in all the different forms of play to ensure they develop into well-rounded people
            (e.g. a child that day dreams more than engages in social play).</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Koffka (1924)</h3>
        <p>In the book <span class="italics">The Growth of the Mind</span> Koffka devoted the final chapter to the child’s world; the world of play. Koffka postulated that children only have a temporal understanding of the world, which does not allow them to draw conclusions based on inferences. </p>
        <p>Children live in the moment and only understand the world in relation to their current environment. Thus, he suggested that play is used to understand the world. For example, he believed that one of the most difficult challenges for a child is to understand what is and is not living. </p>
        <p>Some objects may seem close to living objects, despite the fact that they are not (e.g. dead animals). Children play with objects to discover what reaction the object gives them. Non-living things will generally conform to the wishes of the child, whereas living objects will react in unexpected ways to children’s manipulations. As the child’s mental abilities develop, they become less dependent on play to understand the world and the activity reduces as the child grows.</p>
        <p>Koffka’s contribution to the theory of play for learning was significant for its time. Previous theories of learning
        placed the responsibility of understanding difficult concepts on the child. If a student failed to understand a concept,
        the student was at fault not the method of instruction. </p>
        <p>Koffka, on the other hand, placed the importance of learning on the environment (Bell, 1940). In the 1920s, a neo-Darwinian perspective of development dominated, which posited that some people could develop and learn more than others based on their heredity and race. Two forces were thought to control development: variation, and the correct selection of behaviour for a given stimulus (Koffka, 1924). By suggesting that cognitive ability develop as children learn patterns, not solely according to biology, Koffka drew attention to the importance of the learning environment (Bell, 1940).</p>
        <h3>Huizinga (1949)</h3>
        <p>Huizinga had a very grand perspective on the role of play in learning. He believed that one of the roots of culture and
        learning was play. An example of play creating culture is riddles. Huizinga viewed riddles, the play with language, as
        the precursor to poetry.</p>
        <p>Further, he pointed to the root of the Greek word for school and scholar as evidence of this playful origin. The root meaning for <span class="italics">schole</span> is leisure. The Greeks believed that the first duty of men was to work; when not working they were to pursue education and the arts in their leisure time.</p>
        <p>Huizinga believed that play was a larger part of our lives in the past, but had become hidden. As societies become more complex, they bury the play element under bureaucracy and rules. Play becomes serious, sacred, and professionalized. A more transparent example of the ‘seriousifying’ of play is sports. </p>
        <p>Sports originate as games played in leisure time for fun. However, as they grow in popularity, the rules become formalized and strict, statistics and scores become important, and a division between amateur and professionals develops. The professionalization of sports destroys the play element as player no longer play with the spirit of play, but rather the spirit of work (Huizinga, 1970).</p>
        <p>According to Huizinga, the importance of play in society is that it creates order out of chaos. Reality is not perfectly
        ordered, but the play world does follow rules. All play is governed by rules that are “freely accepted, but absolutely
        binding” (Huizinga, 1970, p. 47). </p>
        <p>Rules allow players to form a shared separate ordered world that is a representation of the real world. Without rules, players could not share the same representation of the play world with each other. The perfectly ordered world severs to help the players make sense of the real world (Huizinga, 1970).</p>
        <h3>Piaget (1951)</h3>
        <p>Piaget was frustrated with the theories of play in that the theories of Groos and other biologically based theories
        focused on the function of play and not the reason for play. This was problematic for Piaget because he believed that
        play could serve any purpose; thus, he was more interested in the existence of play rather than the use of play.</p>
        <p>Further, he believed that the biological theory of Groos suggested that play was instinctual, which Piaget did not
        believe was supported. If play were a biological instinct, then he believed that play and games should not develop as
        cognitive abilities develop. Play should exist independently of higher mental abilities; play should be instinctual.
        Piaget also did not believe that play could be studied as a behaviour. He understood play as an orientation of behaviour
        on a spectrum between play and work.</p>
        <p>For Piaget, play originates as the pleasure derived from exercising newly acquired powers. An example
        would be an adult that drives their new car around the block for no other reason than it is new and fun. The reasons for
        initially playing with their new power are incoherent to the person and simply perceived of as fun. </p>
        <p>However, continuing to exercise power simply because it is fun can be potentially dangerous, thus the behaviour generally either extinguishes or develops into a purposeful activity in one of three ways:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The play behaviour may remain and act as a symbolic understanding</li>
            <ul>
                <li>e.g. Driving the car around the block comes to represent “me time” when the driver can have time to themselves.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>The behaviour can become socialized and begin forming rules</li>
            <ul>
                <li>e.g. People get together at a track to drive around to show off their cars and need to construct regulations for
                safety.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>The behaviour can become adaptive</li>
            <ul>
                <li>e.g. Leisure driving helps the driver learn about the features of the new car.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        <p>As children grow, they develop less new abilities or powers meaning play decreases as we become older as play becomes
        replaced by the above functional activities.</p>
        <h3>Caillois (1961)</h3>
        <p>Caillois wrote <span class="italics">Man, Play, and Games</span> in reaction to Huizinga’s work. He credits Huizinga with demonstrating how play was instrumental in the growth of civilization, although he notes that he believes that “most of its premises are debatable” (Caillois, 1961, p. 3). </p>
        <p>Caillois did see play as a structured parallel world, but focused on how the play world served as practice for the real world. Play allows people to practice behaviours before they require them for real world applications. He suggests children often play by imitating adult behaviour to practice the role they will someday assume. </p>
        <p>Like Huizinga, he believes that the formalization of play has buried the importance of play. For example, play that originated to model and represent the rules of how to behave socially, becomes codes of conduct and then legislation that dictate proper behaviour. He acknowledges this creates a question of what came first, play or seriousness, but suggests that any attempt to understand that is futile. Play and seriousness are integrated and interdependent making it impossible to determine which came first.</p>
        <p>Caillois, much like Piaget, saw play as behaviour on a pole between serious and ludic, and he rejected instinctual
        biological approaches. He thought that the biological approach of Groos, which he believed stressed instinct, overlooked
        the intellectual aspect of play. Play was not done merely for exercise, or testing a skill, and could only exist if
        unconstrained. </p>
        <p>For Caillois, play behaviour is separate from serious behaviour because play is an expression of essential human impulses that are associated with pleasure. He identified four impulses: <span class="italics">argôn</span> (competition), <span class="italics">alea</span> (chance), <span class="italics">mimicry</span> (simulation), and <span class="italics">ilinx</span> (vertigo). </p>
        <p>Behaviours that display <span class="italics">argôn</span> are contests based on skill and/or strength, which are pleasurable for the winner. </p>
        <p><span class="italics">Alea</span> is more passive, and is not behaviour but rather a play rule that introduces chance. An example of alea is a role of the die. It acts as an equalizer in play to ensure that the strongest or smartest will not always win. </p>
        <p><span class="italics">Mimicry</span> is the temporary acceptance of an illusionary world. The players derive pleasure from being able to pretend they are something they are not. </p>
        <p>Finally, <span class="italics">ilinx</span> include activities that disrupt the body’s normal stability of perception and creates panic. When acts of vertigo take place in a safe environment, the panic transforms into fun, e.g. twirling around until one is dizzy. </p>
        <p>Playful behaviour then is, a behaviour done in a way that contains aspects of one or more of these elements that make the purpose of the activity more than just the satisfaction of some need.</p>
        <h3>Vygotsky (1966)</h3>
        <p>Vygotsky wrote an essay on play entitled <span class="italics">Play and its Role in the Mental Development of the Child</span>. Although his contribution to the theory of play was smaller compared to the other listed theorists, his work has been influential. </p>
        <p>Vygotsky shifted the focus to the motivation of children to perform behaviours. Therefore, when he analyzed play, he did so from the perspective of a child’s desire. He wanted to know what needs play satisfied and the motivations for playful
        actions. </p>
        <p>He was wary of theories that defined play as only a symbolic representation of the world because it depicted
        children as incompetents who had to use their play world because they were incapable of actions in the real world.
        Further, those theories again concentrated on the cognitive abilities of the child and not the context of play. However,
        he agreed with most of the above theorists that play was more than pleasure seeking behaviour; play is purposeful.</p>
        <p>He believed that young children understand the world by what they visually perceive. Further, at a young age they are
        incapable of separating the visible world from symbolic meaning. </p>
        <p>For instance, if you ask a young child to say that someone is sitting while that person is actually standing, they will be unable to lie and will say that the person is standing. Therefore, Vygotsky believed that the imaginary nature of play was a transitional development that allowed children to begin to separate concrete from abstract. </p>
        <p>Play allows children to separate the real world from an abstraction of the rules governing their behaviour in a situation. He cites a famous example from Sully of two sisters that play at being sisters. The play is not merely them just being together, but rather, they act out behaviours they believe typify a sisterly relationship.</p> 
        <p>The importance of play then, to Vygotsky, is that the rules of real life become subordinate to the imaginary world. This is important because play can allow a child to act out a role much more advanced than they are capable at their current developmental state. This is because in play, unlike in life, everything follows rules. The child is capable of anything if they follow the rules of the imaginary situation. Thus, play creates a zone of proximal development because the child can complete activities that they are not able to unaided in the real world</p>
