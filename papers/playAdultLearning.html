        <p>Many scholars and educators agree that play is a valuable and natural instructional tool for primary
        education. Yet, there is little research on play in post-secondary education. I contend that play is well suited
        for an academic setting.</p> 
        <p>Caillois’ definition of play, which lists six components of play (free, separate, uncertain, unproductive, governed by rules, and make-believe) (Caillois, 1961), seems to be a workable definition of play irrespective of ideological position. And if we apply his criteria for play to an academic course, there is a parallel. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Students have the freedom to select the course they wish to take and they are free to leave the institution at any time.</li>
            <li>Post-secondary education is separate in that students do not participate in the real world (i.e. career) due to their
            lack of experience. Education is a liminal* space between competencies.</li>
            <li>Education contains uncertainty in many ways. Students are unsure what skills/knowledge they will need for a test, how
            the best way to approach an assignment is, and ultimately, what skills they will need for their future.</li>
            <li>Education is unproductive by its very nature. Education focuses on attaining and retaining knowledge not knowledge
            generation, which is relegated to experts. Education is a time to practice skills in a safe environment under the
            supervision of experts. Students gain experience and skills, but not wealth from production.</li>
            <li>Rules are essential to post-secondary education. There are rules of conduct that pertain to the institution, but also
            students learn the rules of their field.</li>
            <li>Less acknowledged, is the aspect of make-believe in post-secondary education, but it is present. Case study scenarios,
            practice performances/presentations, re-discovery of discovered ideas, etc. are all rooted in the imaginary. Students
            practice performing as if they were the experts they are learning to be.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The advantage of viewing learning as play is that the motivation to achieve is inherent in the activity: the goal of play is to win (Vygotsky, 1966).</p>
        <p>Goffman** argued that if games are fun, and the rules of games are based on people understanding of reality,
        then, all activities had the potential to be fun (Goffman, 1961). The key is to break the world down to its structural
        components. Much like how instructors reduce complex structures down to their understandable rules. </p>
        <p>Games, conveniently, are designed to reduce complex systems into basic understandable structures (Goffman, 1961). Therefore, through play, students can create order out of chaos (Huizinga, 1970) by learning the rules of life through play (Vygotsky,
        1966). </p>
        <p>While playing, the students will be restrained by the imaginary situation (Vygotsky, 1966). Thus by encouraging
        students to reflect on the play rules, they will be able to better understand the real world rules. For example, imagine
        teaching new student-teachers about classroom management skills by having them play “classroom”. </p>
        <blockquote class="fancy">The advantage of viewing learning as play is that the motivation to achieve is inherent in the activity: the goal of play is to win</blockquote>
        <p>One student-teacher would be the teacher, the others the students. The students are to behave based on the restraints of the imaginary situation, meaning that if a student rule is to stop talking when the lights are turned on and off, they will stop
        talking when the lights go on and off. This would allow the “teachers” to play with new approaches to classroom
        management and others (pretending to students) to reflex on what worked and governed their behaviour based on the unsaid
        rules one obeys being a student.</p> 
        <p>Therefore, we can see how play is useful in creating a zone of proximal development. The chaos of a classroom might overwhelm a new student-teacher. However, in the play environment it is a safe ruled and understandable environment where they are free to test and fail at different techniques without real-world penalty. Using a game modeled around this notion, the course instructor would assume at role of a mentor, not an enforcer of learning, because the student-teachers will be motivated to learn how to manage a classroom to win the game.</p>

            <p>* A transitional period between life phases, generally marked by a rite of passage (Turner, 1987).</p>
            <p>** Goffman defined play as action of games (Goffman, 1961). He is not listed in the history of play article because he contributed much more to game studies than he did to the theory of play. Further, his theories focused on social interactions not specifically learning.</p>
