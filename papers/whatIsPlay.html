        <p>It is fitting that I studied the concept of play from an interdisciplinary approach because “[p]lay is a total
        activity. It involves a totality of human behaviour and interests” (Caillois, 1961, p. 175). For simplicity, play is
        often broken down to four basic components: vertigo, chance, competition, and simulation. Therefore to truly understand
        play, one must understand the mathematics and kinesiology of vertigo, the mathematics and statistics of chance, the
        sociology and psychology of competition, and the psychology and neurology of simulation, as well as many other
        disciplines, such as economics and anthropology that inform the study of play (Caillois, 1961). </p>
        <p>This complexity exists because play can serve all purposes (Piaget, 1951); it can serve as practice (Caillois, 1961), expend excess energy (Smith, 2007), teach social skills, and scaffolding (Vygotsky, 1966), for example.</p>
        <p>The complexity of play has made the field rich, but difficult to study. Play itself is a difficult subject to define
        precisely. For example, only the English language has a word for a central aspect of play: fun (Huizinga, 1970).
        Further, play is not truly by definition, a “behaviour". Play is rather the action of a behaviour done on a scale of
        disinterest (outside the realm of play) to pure abandon (quintessential play). </p>
        <p>Thus, the behaviour itself is not play; rather the manner of the behaviour determines the degree of play (Piaget, 1951). However, despite this tricky characterization of play, it undeniably exists. Huizinga (1970) has claimed that nearly all abstractions, such as justice, god, goodness, beauty, etc. are deniable, yet play is not.</p>
        <blockquote class='fancy'><p class='quote'>Play is a total activity. It involves a totality of human behaviour and interests.</p>
        <p class='quote rightAlign'>- Caillois</p></blockquote>
        <p>Understanding play as a spectrum or behaviour between pure abandon and disinterest has lead to the misleading idea that
        play is the opposite of seriousness. If behaviours that are done in a disinterested way for work are not play, and those
        done not to satisfy a need are play (Caillois, 1961), then it is understandable how the misconception of play being
        opposite to seriousness, or earnest emerged (Caillois, 1961; Huizinga, 1970). </p>
        <p>This false dichotomy is problematic. Understanding play as merely fun, or recreational, misrepresents play. For example, not all pleasure is play; children receive pleasure by sucking on their thumbs, yet they are not playing. Further, not all play is fun. Forcing a child to play a sport s/he does not enjoy, or losing at a game may make the experience unenjoyable, despite that it is still considered play (Vygotsky, 1966). In addition, some play is very serious, such as competing in chess (Huizinga, 1970). Clearly, this dichotomy is an unproductive categorization.</p>
        <p>Despite all of the confusion and uncertainty surrounding the concept of play, Caillois has outlined a useable
        definition. He suggested that six attributes are always present in play: free, separate, uncertain, unproductive,
        governed by rules, and make-believe. </p>
        <p>Play is free because players can stop participating at any time with the words “I am not playing anymore”. It is secluded to the created context that the players mutually agreed upon. Uncertain in the sense that the course of play is unforeseeable; it is the product of players’ initiative. Play is unproductive because it does not result in the production of goods or wealth. Rules govern play, but not the ones of everyday life, rules created for playing. Finally, play is make-believe in the sense that the player plays in a pseudo-reality, free from regular constraints, seen in contrast to reality (Caillois, 1961). </p>
        <p>Despite the different theories of play, this definition seems suitable as a working definition of play for the purposes of research.</p>
