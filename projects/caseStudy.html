			<h2>Project Overview</h2>
			<p>This study investigates the experiences and engagement levels of online instructors at the University of Saskatchewan. Through a series of interviews conducted over a year, the research aims to understand the factors influencing instructors' participation and satisfaction in online teaching environments.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="feature-content">
			<h3>The Challenge</h3>
			<p>This project explores how online instructors experience engagement in the context of teaching at a research-intensive university. The study centers on the University of Saskatchewan and uses a case study approach to examine how institutional culture, workload, and personal motivation shape instructors’ participation in online teaching.</p>
			<p>The research question: <strong>How do online instructors experience and describe engagement in their teaching practice within a research-intensive university setting?</strong></p>
			<p>Over the course of one year, twelve instructors were interviewed three times each to capture a longitudinal view of their teaching engagement. The study used a mixed-methods analysis that combined qualitative themes with sentiment scoring to assess the emotional tone of their reflections.</p>
			
			<h3>Key Findings</h3>
			<ul class="feature-list">
				<li>Institutional emphasis on research often overshadowed teaching responsibilities, leading to feelings of disconnection or decreased motivation among some instructors.</li>
				<li>Instructors who identified more strongly with teaching as a professional identity tended to demonstrate higher and more consistent engagement.</li>
				<li>Personal strategies for managing time and stress—such as scheduling boundaries and self-reflection—played a critical role in maintaining engagement.</li>
				<li>The tone of instructors’ reflections shifted over time, with those experiencing increased institutional support or improved work-life balance showing a more positive sentiment by the final interview.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Overall, this project highlights the complex and evolving nature of engagement in online instruction, particularly in environments where research output is prioritized. It emphasizes the need for institutions to foster a culture that values and supports teaching to ensure instructor well-being and student success.</p>

			<h2>Research Context</h2>
		</div>
		
		<div class="research-grid">
			<div class="research-card">
				<h4>Instructor Engagement is Underexplored</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Most online education research focuses on students, technology, or course design.</li>
					<li>There’s limited research on how instructors experience online teaching, especially their emotional and professional engagement.</li>
					<li>Instructor engagement is often assumed rather than deeply examined.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="research-card">
				<h4>Engagement is Contextual and Shaped by Institutions</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Instructor engagement isn’t static. It shifts based on workload, identity, and institutional culture.</li>
					<li>At research-intensive universities, teaching is often secondary to research in performance evaluations.</li>
					<li>This dynamic can lead to reduced motivation and participation in online courses.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="research-card">
				<h4>Lack of Understanding of Instructor Perspectives</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>While instructor presence and enthusiasm are known to affect student success, few studies at the point of this research centred on instructors' own voices.</li>
					<li>There was a gap in understanding how instructors define, interpret, and sustain engagement over time.</li>
					<li>Institutional support (or lack thereof) plays a crucial role in these experiences.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="research-card">
				<h4>Addressing a Research and Practice Gap</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>This study gives instructors a platform to share their lived experiences.</li>
					<li>It responds to the tension between research and teaching in academia.</li>
					<li>The goal is to shift the conversation toward a more human-centered view of online education.</li>

			<h2>Key Research Findings</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="research-grid">
			<div class="research-card">
				<h4>Institutional Priorities Shape Engagement</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Instructors perceived a strong institutional emphasis on research over teaching, which often led to lower engagement in online course design and delivery.</li>
					<li>Some felt teaching was undervalued, especially in tenure and promotion discussions.</li>
					<li>This tension created emotional strain for instructors who cared deeply about their teaching.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="research-card">
				<h4>Teaching Identity Matters</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Instructors who identified strongly as educators first (rather than primarily researchers) reported higher levels of engagement with online teaching tasks.</li>
					<li>These instructors found it easier to invest time in course design and student interaction.</li>
					<li>Teaching-oriented faculty expressed more positive engagement in their work.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="research-card">
				<h4>Time and Workload Management are Critical</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Competing demands between research, teaching, and personal responsibilities were a major source of disengagement.</li>
					<li>Instructors who developed structured routines and boundaries were better able to stay engaged.</li>
					<li>Those lacking time-management strategies often described burnout or detachment from their courses.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="research-card">
				<h4>Emotional Tone Reflects Engagement</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>The sentiment analysis revealed clear emotional patterns:
						<ul>
							<li>More positive language often aligned with feelings of autonomy, support, and purpose.</li>
							<li>More negative language reflected frustration, fatigue, and misalignment with institutional values.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>These emotional shifts provided a unique, data-driven view of how instructors felt across time.</li>

			<div class="feature-content">
				<h3>Limitations</h3>
				<p>While this research offers valuable insights, several limitations should be acknowledged:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The study focuses on a single institution, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other academic settings.</li>
					<li>The sample size (12 instructors) is small, though typical for in-depth qualitative research.</li>
					<li>Emotional sentiment was assessed using researcher-coded valence, which, while systematic, involves interpretive judgment and may carry some subjectivity.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Despite these limitations, the study provides a strong foundation for future research and institutional reflection on online teaching practices.</p>
