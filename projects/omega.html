			<h2>Project Overview</h2>
			<p>OMEGA+ is an innovative online multiplayer gaming platform designed to enhance users' metacognitive skills through engaging and interactive gameplay. Metacognitive skills—such as problem-solving, associative reasoning, planning and organization, and accuracy in evaluation—are critical for effective learning and adaptability in various contexts. Despite their importance, traditional educational methods often struggle to effectively cultivate these skills. OMEGA+ addresses this challenge by integrating targeted skill development into a dynamic gaming environment, making the learning process both enjoyable and effective. </p>

				<h3>The Challenge</h3>
				<p>In the contemporary educational landscape, there's a notable gap in effectively teaching metacognitive skills. Traditional pedagogical approaches may not sufficiently engage learners or provide the practical, hands-on experiences necessary for developing these higher-order thinking skills. This deficiency can hinder students' ability to become self-regulated learners capable of planning, monitoring, and evaluating their own learning processes. Recognizing this shortfall, the challenge was to create an educational tool that not only imparts knowledge but also actively engages users in developing their metacognitive abilities in a manner that is both effective and enjoyable.</p>
				<p>The research question: <strong>How can an online multiplayer game be designed to effectively improve users' metacognitive skills, thereby enhancing their overall learning capabilities and adaptability?</strong> This question aimed to explore the potential of game-based learning as a medium for metacognitive skill development and to identify the game design elements that contribute to this objective. ​</p>
				
				<h3>Key Innovations</h3>
				<ul class="feature-list">
					<li><strong>Targeted Subgames:</strong> The platform comprises a series of subgames, each meticulously designed to focus on specific metacognitive skills. For instance, games like "Bypass" enhance problem-solving abilities, while "Pattern Hacker" develops associative reasoning.</li>
					<li><strong>Competitive Multiplayer Environment:</strong> By incorporating competitive elements, OMEGA+ fosters a stimulating environment where players are motivated to improve their skills to outperform peers.</li>
					<li><strong>Integrated Learning Analytics:</strong> The platform features a personalized dashboard that provides players with detailed feedback on their performance. This integration of learning analytics allows users to monitor their progress, identify areas for improvement, and make informed decisions about their learning strategies. </li>
