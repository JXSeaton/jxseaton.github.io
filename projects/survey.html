			<h2>Project Overview</h2>
			<p>This project explores the engagement and satisfaction of university instructors involved in online teaching. Using a detailed survey at a research-intensive Canadian university, the study examines what factors support—or hinder—instructors as they navigate the complexities of teaching in a digital environment.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="feature-content">
			<h3>The Research Question:</h3>
			<p><strong>What institutional, professional, and personal factors influence instructor engagement and satisfaction in online teaching?</strong></p>
			<p>To answer this, the study employed a range of validated survey scales and conducted statistical analyses to uncover patterns and predictors of engagement. The findings provide practical insights for universities aiming to improve support for online faculty.</p>
			
			<h3>Key Findings</h3>
			<ul class="feature-list">
				<li><strong>Engagement is Complex:</strong> Instructor engagement in online teaching is influenced by multiple, sometimes conflicting, factors like institutional support, personal identity, and time constraints.</li>
				<li><strong>Institutional Policies Matters:</strong> Instatutional re-structuring had a negative impact on online instructor engagement.</li>
				<li><strong>Personal and Contextual Factors Interact:</strong> Instructor engagement varies widely across individuals, disciplines, and departments, suggesting that one-size-fits-all solutions may not be effective.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Research Context</h2>
		</div>
		<p>Online education has grown rapidly in higher education, yet instructor engagement remains an underexplored area. While student experiences in online learning are widely studied, less is known about the people teaching those courses, particularly how they are supported, motivated, or challenged by institutional structures.</p>
		<div class="research-grid">
			<div class="research-card">
				<h4>Invisible Labor in Online Teaching</h4>
				<p>Online instruction often involves significant behind-the-scenes work—course design, technology setup, and student communication—which is frequently undervalued by institutions.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="research-card">
				<h4>Professional Identity in Flux</h4>
				<p>Faculty members juggle multiple roles: researcher, teacher, advisor, administrator. In environments that prioritize research output, those with a strong teaching identity may feel unsupported or isolated.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="research-card">
				<h4>Institutional Culture and Policy Gaps</h4>
				<p>Many institutions lack consistent policies or recognition structures for online teaching. Understanding how faculty perceive and experience support (or lack thereof) is essential for building better systems.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="research-card">
				<h4>A Need for Broader Evidence</h4>
				<p>While small, qualitative studies have explored these issues anecdotally, this study brings a data-driven, scalable approach to uncovering trends that institutions can act on.</p>

			<h2>Methodology</h2>
		</div>
		<p>This study used a quantitative, survey-based approach to capture instructors' perceptions, behaviors, and engagement levels in online teaching. The survey featured 61 question and included demographics question and drew from three validated scales.</p>
		<h3>Survey Design</h3>
		<p>The survey included several validated measurement scales:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Schaufeli’s Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES):</strong> Assesses engagement based on energy, dedication, and focus.</li>
			<li><strong>Online Faculty Satisfaction Survey (OFSS):</strong> This scale assesses satisfaction in three areas. Student related factors, such as interaction with students and the academic performance of the students. Instructor related factors, including intrinsic motivation, use of technology, and opportunity for professional development. And institutional related factors, which focus on policies and faculty support.</li>
			<li><strong>m Time Management Behaviours Scale:</strong> This scale assesses the instructors goal and priority setting, use of scheduling and planning devices, and preference for organization.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Data Collection and Analysis</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The survey was distributed to online instructors at the University across various disciplines.</li>
			<li>Statistical analyses included:
				<ul>
					<li>Descriptive statistics to map broad trends.</li>
					<li>Correlation analysis to explore relationships between variables.</li>
					<li>Regression analysis to identify predictors of instructor engagement.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>This methodology allowed the me to go beyond anecdote, building a clearer picture of what actually influences engagement at scale and adding to previous qualitative research.</p>

			<h2>Key Research Findings</h2>
			<p>This survey-based study explored the attitudes, motivations, and institutional perceptions of online instructors. Unlike the <a href="./caseStudy.html">previous qualitative study</a>, the data here revealed distinct trends in instructor engagement that challenge assumptions about institutional support and professional identity.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="research-grid">
			<div class="research-card">
				<h4>Mixed Levels of Engagement</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Instructors reported moderate levels of engagement, with many expressing a sense of purpose in their teaching.</li>
					<li>However, this engagement was often accompanied by feelings of exhaustion, stemming from time pressures and lack of recognition.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="research-card">
				<h4>Low Institutional Identification</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Many instructors did not feel strongly connected to their institution, even if they enjoyed their teaching roles.</li>
					<li>There was a notable disconnect between personal teaching values and institutional priorities.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="research-card">
				<h4>Teaching Identity Was Not a Strong Predictor</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Contrary to expectations, a strong teaching identity did not consistently correlate with higher engagement.</li>
					<li>Some instructors who saw themselves as teachers still felt isolated or undervalued within the broader university context.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="research-card">
				<h4>Engagement is Multi-Faceted and Contextual</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>The findings suggest that instructor engagement is not easily explained by any single factor.</li>
					<li>Engagement appeared to be episodic and variable, shaped by individual, departmental, and institutional factors that interact in complex ways.</li>
					<li>However, survey tools such as the one designed in this study can be used to better understand engagement at an institution at a low cost.</li>
				</ul>

		<div class="section-title">
			<h2>Impact</h2>
			<p>This project provides a cautionary insight into the complexity of faculty engagement in online learning. Unlike more optimistic or linear models, this study shows that instructor engagement can coexist with fatigue, frustration, and institutional detachment.</p>
		</div>
		<p>Practical Implications:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Institutions should avoid one-size-fits-all approaches to supporting online instructors.</li>
			<li>Institutions should utilize survey's to better undstand how instructor engagaement is impacted based on their culture.</li>
			<li>Recognition systems and support structures need to be more personalized and flexible, acknowledging diverse motivations and work contexts.</li>
			<li>The findings invite leaders to rethink how teaching contributions are valued, especially in research-focused environments.</li>
		</ul>		
		<h3>Limitations</h3>
		<p>While this research offers valuable insights, a limitation of the study is that the results are based on one research-intensive university and may not generalize to teaching-focused colleges or hybrid institutions.</p>
